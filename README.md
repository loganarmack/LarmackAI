# SubstringGame
A word game in which the user is given a random substring and must enter
a real word containing the substring.

## To install packages:
`$ pipenv install`

You'll also need to download the list of words from nltk. To do this:
```
$ python
>>> import nltk
>>> nltk.download('words')
```

You can then run the game with 
`pipenv run python game.py`
