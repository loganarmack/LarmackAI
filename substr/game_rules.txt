**Substring Game Rules** \
Each round, you will be given a group of letters. You will have {guess_time} seconds 
to enter a real English word containing this group somewhere in the word. If you can't think 
of something in time, you will lose a life.
\\
If you enter a correct word in time, you'll gain points based on the difficulty of the letter group and 
the length of your word, with a small bonus for using the substring in the middle rather than at the start. 
Additionally, you'll gain a bonus life each time you use all the letters in the alphabet once, so try to 
come up with words that use the remaining "letters to bonus". 
\\
Keep in mind that you can only use each word once, so be creative. 
\\
You start with {starting_lives} lives, and the game ends once your lives reach 0. Good luck!
